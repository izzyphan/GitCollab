Group 3: Emily, Isabelle, Henry, Matt, and Christan 

B. We had two person change the name of a docuemnt title and and had one commit and push
and the other person just commit, but an error will show up if they try to push because the origin is ahead.

C. Student 1 is working the develop_branch on a text file adding information regarding the introduction of the project and is able to sucessfull commit and push everyuthing
 and student b is working on the conflict_branch on the same text file, but adding information about the daily scrum meeting at the end of the documet.
Student B would have no problem because Git can merge the changes automatically onlu if the commits are onm different lines or branches.
